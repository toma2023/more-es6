        <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-red-900"> 1. What's the difference between map, foreach, filter? </h3>
        <p class="text-2xl mt-2 ">The first difference between map() and forEach() is the returning value. The forEach() method returns undefined and map() returns a new array with the transformed elements. Even if they do the same job, the returning value remains different.</p>
        <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-red-900"> 2. What's the difference between filter and find? </h3>
        <p class="text-2xl mt-2 ">Filter() returns an array containing the element that satisfies the condition, but find() returns the element itself that satisfies the condition. In filter() , whole array is iterated despite the fact that the element being searched for is present at the beginning.</p>
        <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-red-900"> 3. What is the difference between for..of and for..in? </h3>
        <p class="text-2xl mt-2"> Difference between for...of and for...in
            The main difference between them is in what they iterate over. The for...in statement iterates over the enumerable string properties of an object, while the for...of statement iterates over values that the iterable object defines to be iterated over.</p>
        <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-red-900"> 4. How do you empty an array? </h3>
        <p class="text-2xl mt-2">This is the fastest way to empty an array: a = []; This code assigned the array a to a new empty array. It works perfectly if you do not have any references to the original array.</p>
        <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-red-900"> 5. Difference between class and object? </h3>
        <p class="text-2xl mt-2">A class defines object properties including a valid range of values, and a default value. A class also describes object behavior. An object is a member or an "instance" of a class. An object has a state in which all of its properties have values that you either explicitly define or that are defined by default settings.</p>
        <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-red-900"> 6.What is a prototype chain ? Or how does inheritance work in JavaScript?</h3>
        <p class="text-2xl mt-2">When it comes to inheritance, JavaScript only has one construct: objects. Each object has a private property which holds a link to another object called its prototype. That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype.</p>
        <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-red-900"> 7. What does destructing do in es6? </h3>
        <p class="text-2xl mt-2">Destructuring means to break down a complex structure into simpler parts. With the syntax of destructuring, you can extract smaller fragments from objects and arrays. It can be used for assignments and declaration of a variable.</p>
        <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-red-900"> 8. Is optional chaining is same as ternary operator? </h3>
        <p class="text-2xl mt-2">It's also known as the ternary conditional operator because it combines some of what the ternary operator does together with the chaining operator, normally called dot notation. It's similar to the traditional dot syntax which lets you access an object and its properties.</p>
        <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-red-900"> 9. What do you mean by dot notation and bracket notation? When should you use dot notation or bracket notation? </h3>
        <p class="text-2xl mt-2 mb-10">Dot notation is faster to write and easier to read than bracket notation. However, you can use variables with bracket notation, but not with dot notation. This is especially useful for situations when you want to access a property but don't know the name of the property ahead of time.</p>
